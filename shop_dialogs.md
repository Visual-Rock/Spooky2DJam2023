# Shop Dargan

Dargan:
	Ah, Baldur, my friend! What brings you to my humble abode today?
	I've heard you want to trade some of your {{lux_amount}} Lux? I got the best gadgets and gizmos to help you on your quest to save the lumens!
	Take a look around, you might find something valuable in return.

Dargan:
	I've got some new items that might pique your interest. Check out these beauties!
	[ Feast your eyes on this, the "Stealth Cape." With this magical garment, you can move silently, evading the gaze of any lurking enemies. Sneak past them like a shadow in the night!
	[ And for the speedster in you, how about these "Supersonic Shoes"? They're imbued with magic to make you run faster than the wind itself. These shoes channel your energy, making your movements quicker and more agile. You'll cover ground in no time, and those pesky shadows won't stand a chance.
	But remember, lux is a precious resource in our world, and you'll want to spend it wisely. You got only {{lux_amount}} Lux to spend.

Dargan:
	It's been a pleasure doing business with you, Baldur. Your lux help keep my shop running, and I'm always here to support your mission.
	Remember, the shadows may be dark, but your light shines brighter with every step. Farewell for now, and may luck guide your way.

Dargan:
	Baldur, I must admit, it seems that my shop is currently empty. I'm in the process of restocking and crafting new marvels for your adventure.
	Until then, be safe out there, and we'll meet again soon.

# Shop Ziya

Ziya:
	Welcome, my dear friend Baldur. It's good to see you again. The darkness grows stronger, but I'm here to help you shine some light on your journey.
	I see you brought {{candela_amount}} candela with you. I can work my magic, transforming it into lux for you.
	But, before you trade your candela for lux, remember that it's also what keeps your torch burning brightly. Spending too much candela might make your torch shine less brightly and make it harder to navigate the darkness.

Ziya:
	Hand me your candela. My magic, dear Baldur, is rooted in the essence of light and darkness. I can transform candela into lux by harnessing the energy of the lumens you've saved, creating a unique exchange between the forces of illumination and obscurity.
	Each piece of candela is a glimmer of hope in this darkness.
	Baldur, how much candela would you like me to transform into lux for you today?

Ziya:
	It's time for you to continue your journey, Baldur. Remember, I'll always be here to help you transform candela into lux whenever you need.
	Stay safe, keep that torch burning, and know that I'm cheering you on every step of the way. Goodbye for now, my friend.

Ziya:
	I see, Baldur. You're choosing to hold onto your candela for now. That's perfectly fine. Whenever you change your mind or need assistance, you know where to find me. Until then, take care on your quest, and may your light guide you. Goodbye for now, my friend.
