Lumen:
    Please help us!
    They have taken us hostage. We, the lumens, are needed to make nature work.
    We are the light that you see. The dark Lord Blackburn has captured us to spread his darkness.

Baldur:
    Sure. How can we help?

Lumen:
    Please go out into the darkness and look for them. But be aware that there are monsters out there who want to hurt you.

Dargan:
    Baldur, you have the torch, so at least you can see a little in the dark.
    I can provide you with helpful upgrades, but I need Lux to make them work.

Baldur:
    Where do I get Lux from?

Ziya:
    I, Ziya, can help with that. But for that I need Candela.

Baldur:
    And where do I get Candela from?

Lumen:
    Each lumen has a certain amount of candela that it can give you if you save it.
    But be aware that your torch gets brighter with each candela you collect, so convert them wisely.

Baldur:
    Okay. I'm going to save all lumens.
