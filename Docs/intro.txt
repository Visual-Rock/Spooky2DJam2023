Lumen:
    Baldur, you've got to help us! Blackburn... He's taken the Lumens hostage, and he wants to spread darkness all around the village.

Baldur:
    Hang in there. I won't let Blackburn succeed. we'll need to rescue the Lumens to stop him.

Lumen:
    Thank you, Baldur. The more Lumens you rescue, the weaker Blackburn's grip on the village becomes. Plus, for each Lumen you save, you'll earn Candela, making your torch shine brighter.

Ziya:
    Hey, Baldur! Need to make some trades? You can swap your Candela for Lux with me. Lux is invaluable in these dark times.

Baldur:
    Thanks, Ziya. I'll remember that. I we'll get the Lumens out of there, but to confront Blackburn, we'll need some upgrades.

Ziya:
    Head over to Dargan. He's got incredible upgrades that can help you save the Lumens more efficiently.

Baldur:
    And where do I get Candela from?

Lumen:
    Each lumen has a certain amount of candela that it can give you if you save it.
    But be aware that your torch gets brighter with each candela you collect, so convert them wisely.

Baldur:
    Okay. I'm going to save all lumens.
